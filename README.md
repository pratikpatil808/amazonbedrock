# Amazon Bedrock API Notebooks

Welcome to the **Amazon Bedrock API Notebooks** repository! This repository provides hands-on sample Jupyter Notebooks for working with the **Amazon Bedrock service**. These notebooks are designed to help you quickly understand how to interact with Bedrock’s API.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to provide practical, easily understandable code samples for developers and data scientists who are looking to leverage Amazon Bedrock’s powerful API capabilities.

# Amazon Bedrock
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies and Amazon available for your use through a unified API. You can choose from a wide range of foundation models to find the model that is best suited for your use case. Amazon Bedrock also offers a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can easily experiment with and evaluate top foundation models for your use cases, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources.

AWS offers the following tools to streamline your experience:

1) AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)

2) AWS SDKs

3) Amazon SageMaker AI notebooks

To get started with the API, you need credentials to grant programmatic access. 

This repository contains sample Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating how to access and interact with Amazon Bedrock's API. The goal is to provide easy-to-follow, hands-on examples that the community can adapt and build upon.
